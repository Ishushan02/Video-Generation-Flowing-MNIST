# Video-Generation-Flowing-MNIST

This project explores deep learning-based video generation using a hybrid model that combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** units. The model is trained on the **Moving MNIST** dataset to predict future frames of handwritten digits in motion.

## Dataset: Moving MNIST

The **Moving MNIST** dataset consists of 10,000 video sequences. Each sequence contains:

* **20 grayscale frames**, each of size **64×64 pixels**
* **Two handwritten digits** moving independently and randomly within the frame
* Digits **bounce off the frame boundaries** and often **intersect or overlap**

### Example Input Video

Below is a sample sequence from the Moving MNIST dataset:

## Approach 1: ConvLSTM Model

The first approach uses a **ConvLSTM model**, which integrates convolutional operations into LSTM units, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics effectively.

### Model Details

* Input: First 10 frames of a sequence
* Output: Next 10 predicted frames
* Architecture: Convolutional-LSTM network
* Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Optimizer: Adam
* Trained for: 70 Epochs

## Approach 2 VIT
    - Used 10:10 samples for prediction fot MSE Loss till 0.0146..
    - Now introducing Perceptual Loss (I am combining VGG and MSE) anlong with itterative prediction

    
Sure! Here's a **short and concise `README.md`** summarizing your Vision Transformer-based video generation model:

# Video Generation - Moving MNIST

This project explores deep learning for video frame prediction using the **Moving MNIST** dataset.

## 🗃 Dataset

* **Moving MNIST**: 20-frame sequences of two digits moving within a 64×64 grayscale frame.
* Task: Predict the next 10 frames from the first 10.

## Approach 2: Vision Transformer (ViT)

A Transformer-based model using patch embeddings and spatiotemporal attention to predict future frames.

### Model Highlights

* **Patch Embedding**: Each 64×64 frame is divided into 8×8 patches.
* **Transformer Encoder**: 6-layer encoder captures space-time relations.
* **Decoder**: Linear + ConvTranspose layers reconstruct full frames.
* **Input/Output**: 10 input frames → 10 predicted frames
* **Loss**: MSE along with integrating VGG-based Perceptual Loss.
