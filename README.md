# Video-Generation-Flowing-MNIST

- This project explores video generation using a combination of Convolutional and LSTM layers to model and predict the motion of handwritten digits from the Moving MNIST dataset.

- The Moving MNIST dataset contains 10,000 video sequences, each consisting of 20 frames. In each video sequence, two digits move independently around the frame, which has a spatial resolution of 64Ã—64 pixels. The digits frequently intersect with each other and bounce off the edges of the frame
